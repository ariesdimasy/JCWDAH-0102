            <p>Computers are electronic devices that process data and perform tasks according to a set of instructions
                called programs. They have become an essential part of modern life, enabling people to work,
                communicate,
                and access information efficiently.</p>
            <p>There are various types of computers, ranging from large mainframes used by organizations to personal
                computers and laptops for individual use. Each type serves different purposes based on processing power,
                storage capacity, and portability.</p>
            <p>Computers operate using both hardware and software components. Hardware refers to the physical parts like
                the
                processor, memory, and storage devices, while software includes the operating system and applications
                that
                run on the hardware.</p>
            <p>With the advancement of technology, computers have become faster, smaller, and more affordable. They play
                a
                crucial role in fields such as education, healthcare, business, and entertainment, shaping the way
                people
                live and work.</p>

            <p>Servicing a computer begins with turning off the device and unplugging it from any power source to ensure
                safety during maintenance.</p>
            <p>Next, carefully open the computer case using the appropriate tools, such as a screwdriver, to access the
                internal components.</p>
            <p>Use compressed air to remove dust and debris from fans, vents, and other internal parts, as dust buildup
                can
                cause overheating.</p>
            <p>Check all cables and connections to ensure they are secure and not damaged, as loose connections can lead
                to
                hardware malfunctions.</p>
            <p>Inspect the hard drive and memory modules for signs of wear or failure, and replace them if necessary to
                maintain optimal performance.</p>
            <p>Update the operating system and all installed software to the latest versions to protect the computer
                from
                security vulnerabilities.</p>
            <p>Run a full antivirus scan to detect and remove any malware or unwanted programs that could affect system
                stability.</p>
            <p>Defragment the hard drive if you are using a traditional HDD, as this can improve data access speeds and
                overall performance.</p>
            <p>Clean the keyboard, mouse, and monitor with appropriate cleaning solutions to maintain hygiene and
                usability.
            </p>
            <p>Finally, reassemble the computer, plug it back in, and test all functions to ensure the servicing was
                successful and the system runs smoothly.</p>
